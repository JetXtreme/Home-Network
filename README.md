# Home Network and SIEM Lab Project
This repository documents the design, setup, and ongoing improvements to my advanced home network. It also outlines my future plans to implement a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system in a homelab environment. The project focuses on building a secure, scalable, and high-performance network while developing hands-on networking and cybersecurity skills.

## üì° Network Overview

### **Key Components**
- **Ubiquiti USG 3P**: Central router and firewall, providing advanced traffic routing, NAT, and security capabilities.
- **Ubiquiti AC Pro**: High-performance wireless access point delivering reliable Wi-Fi coverage.
- **Linksys Switch**: Repurposed as a Layer 2 switch to expand Ethernet connectivity.
- **End Devices**: A mix of wired and wireless devices, including PCs, smart TVs, smartphones, and IoT devices.

### **Network Topology**

![Network Topology](./topology.png)

This setup includes:
- Ubiquiti USG 3P as the router and firewall.
- Ubiquiti AC Pro for wireless connectivity.
- Linksys switch for wired device expansion.

## üîß Features and Configurations

### **Current Features**
- **Firewall Rules**: Configured on the USG to secure traffic and prevent unauthorized access.
- **IP Management**: DHCP handled by the USG, with both dynamic and static IP assignments.
- **Traffic Segmentation**: Planning VLANs for IoT, guest, and trusted device isolation.
- **Traffic Monitoring**: Real-time monitoring via UniFi Controller.

### **Future Plans**
- **Homelab SIEM Implementation**:
  - Deploy a SIEM (e.g., Splunk, ELK Stack, or Graylog) to collect and analyze logs from network devices.
  - Set up automated alerts for detecting suspicious activity.
- **Advanced Security**:
  - VLAN implementation for isolating traffic.
  - Deploy IDS/IPS for intrusion detection/prevention.
- **Home Automation Integration**:
  - Secure IoT devices with VLAN segmentation.
